oh-my-zsh-agnoster-mod-theme
============================

I really love this agnoster theme for oh-my-zsh but it lacks one thing I needed: a nice right prompt!

Itâ€™s already built-in in oh-my-zsh, so why not use it?

Set Up
------

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a symlink of **agnoster-nanof.zsh-theme** in **.oh-my-zsh/themes/** (ok this is a pretty way to keep your theme up-to-date if for any reason I would update this theme). You can also just say yolo and copy **agnoster-nanof.zsh-theme** in **.oh-my-zsh/themes/**. It's up to you!

3. Configure the theme in your **~/.zshrc**:

    ```
    ZSH_THEME="agnoster-nanof"
    ```
